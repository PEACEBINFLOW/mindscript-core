## 🔥 What Is MindScript?

MindScript is an AI-native prompting language engineered for deterministic, programmable, multi-modal reasoning. It transforms prompts into structured programs that AI models execute with strict adherence to structure, modality logic, and stage sequencing.

MindScript enables:

- deterministic multi-stage execution  
- formal syntax for prompting  
- modality-specific reasoning (text, diagram, image, video, automation)  
- ledger-based recall  
- surface-language compression  
- cross-model compatibility
